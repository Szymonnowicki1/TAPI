# API Documentation

## Overview

This API provides access to the tennis project functionality. It is designed to manage players, matches, and tournaments in a sports application. The API is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **GraphQL**.

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: The server is built using Node.js for asynchronous, non-blocking operations.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build the REST API endpoints.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Swagger**: Used to document the REST API with interactive and easy-to-understand documentation.
